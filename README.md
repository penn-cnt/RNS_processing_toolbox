# RNS Processing Toolbox

This repository contains code for processing and analyzing data from the responsive neurostimulation (RNS) device by NeuroPace. 

Note: This toolbox is very much still in progress and may not be fully tested for all systems. 


Setup instructions and information about using the toolbox can be found in the [project wiki](https://github.com/b-schd/RNS_processing_toolbox/wiki)
